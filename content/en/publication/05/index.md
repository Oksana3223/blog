# 🌱 Study and Rest Balance  

## Why is it important?  

A student’s life is often short on time: lectures, seminars, projects, exams.  
Sometimes you feel like studying non-stop, but **overload reduces efficiency** and leads to burnout.  

Balancing study and rest is not a luxury but a necessity.

## Tips for maintaining balance  

- ⏰ **Plan your time**: use a calendar and break the day into blocks.  
- 🧘 **Take breaks**: 5–10 minutes of rest after 40–50 minutes of study.  
- 🏃 **Physical activity**: sports help unload the brain.  
- 📚 **Alternate tasks**: theory + practice, mental + creative activities.  
- 😴 **Sleep**: 7–8 hours of sleep is the foundation of productivity.
