# 🔄 Version Control. Git  

## What is version control?  

Version control is the process of systematically tracking changes in source code, documentation, configurations, and other digital artifacts.  
It is a fundamental tool in software development that allows you to:  

- 🕒 save the history of changes and roll back to previous versions;  
- 👥 collaborate on a project with multiple developers;  
- 🔍 analyze who made changes and when;  
- ⚖️ manage multiple versions of the same product (e.g., release and experimental branch).  

Without version control, a project quickly loses structure: changes overwrite each other, duplicate files appear, and important data is lost.

## Git – the main version control tool  

**Git** is a distributed version control system (VCS) created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for Linux kernel development.  
Today, Git has become the de facto standard in programming.  

### 🔹 Key features of Git  

- **Distributed** — every developer has a complete clone of the repository with its history, enabling offline work.  
- **Fast** — operations are performed locally and take milliseconds.  
- **Flexible** — supports complex workflows, branching, and merging.  
- **Reliable** — all changes are secured with unique SHA-1 hashes.

## 📂 Basic principles of working with Git  

1. **Local and remote repositories**  
   - A repository is a database of the project with its history.  
   - The local repository is stored on your computer, while the remote one is on a server (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).  

2. **Commits and change history**  
   - A commit is a “snapshot” of the project at a given time.  
   - Each commit contains the author, date, description, and hash.  
   - The hash guarantees the immutability of the history.  

3. **Branching and merging**  
   - Branches allow parallel work on features, bug fixes, or experiments.  
   - The main branch is usually called `main` or `master`.  
   - Once work is finished, changes are merged back into the main branch.  

4. **Conflict resolution**  
   - If changes overlap in the same file, Git cannot merge automatically.  
   - The developer must manually decide which lines to keep.  
   - Conflicts are a normal part of collaborative development.  

5. **Teamwork**  
   - A popular model is **Git Flow**: separate branches for development, releases, and hotfixes.  
   - Collaboration often uses **pull requests** (or merge requests) where code is reviewed before merging.

## 🔧 Essential Git commands  

```bash
# Create a new repository
git init

# Clone an existing project
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

# Check status
git status

# Add files to commit
git add file.txt

# Create a commit
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# View history
git log

# Create a new branch
git branch feature-branch

# Switch to a branch
git checkout feature-branch

# Merge a branch into main
git merge feature-branch

# Push changes to server
git push origin main

# Pull changes from server
git pull
```

## 🤔 Why Git is better than just copying files?  

| Storage method             | Version control | Rollback possible | Teamwork supported |  
|----------------------------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|  
| Simple file copying        | ❌ No           | ❌ No            | ❌ No             |  
| Git                        | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes           | ✅ Yes            |  

Git enables systematic project work: every version is preserved in history, and collaboration becomes transparent and manageable.

## 🌍 GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket  

Git is a tool, but for team collaboration, platforms are used:  

- **GitHub** — the largest platform for open-source projects.  
- **GitLab** — focused on enterprise use, supports CI/CD.  
- **Bitbucket** — integrates with Jira and other Atlassian tools.  

These services let you store code in the cloud, manage tasks, run automated tests, and deploy projects.

## 🧑‍💻 Practical use cases of Git  

- **Education** — storing lab work and coursework projects.  
- **Science** — tracking changes in research code and scripts.  
- **Business** — developing corporate applications and products.  
- **Hobbies** — maintaining personal pet projects and contributing to open source.

## 📌 Conclusion  

Git is not just a tool but an industry standard. It simplifies working on projects of any scale — from student projects to global open-source systems.  

If you’re planning a career in IT, learning Git is not optional — it’s essential.
